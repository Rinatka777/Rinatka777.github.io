## Introduction

Hi, I’m **Rinat Sharifullin**, and I study linguistics at the **University of Helsinki**. Before that i have been an emergency room nurse for 6 years.  
I have always been passionate about **programming** and tech-stuff in general and even got a chance to work as a **software engineer** for 1.5 years. 
Now my focus switched a bit towards **Natural Language Processing**, **Machine Translation** because next year I move forward to a master's degree in 
**Language technology**.
Outside of university, I am passionate about **Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu** and in my free time I either train or code.

### Churn predictors
A model that can predict if a customer will churn or not based on their data.
### 🧹 Manga-parser
My friend told me he is afraid that his favorite manga is going to be deleted, so I made a parser that gathers all the manga in one pdf file.
### ⚙️ Command-Line Course Website
This very site — documenting what I learned about SSH, processes, and Jekyll.
