# Command-Line Course

This page documents what I learned during the Command-Line Tools f-77RO course. 

## Introduction
In this course I learned to use the terminal for file management,text editing, automation, and remote computing.  
I practiced on both macOS and the CSC Puhti setting up SSH keys, transferring files, and managing long-running processes.  


## Week 1: Basic Commands and Processes
**Main topics:**  
- File and directory operations (`ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`)  
- File viewing (`cat`, `less`, `head`, `tail`)  
- Permissions (`chmod`)  
- Process management (`ps`, `top`, `kill`)

**Reflection:**  
This week built the foundation for understanding how the operating system organizes and tracks running tasks.


## Week 2: SSH and Remote Work
**Main topics:**  
- Secure Shell (SSH) basics  
- Generating and using Ed25519 SSH keys  
- Copying files remotely with `scp`  
- Understanding remote file paths and user permissions

**Reflection:**  
Setting up SSH and using remote directories gave me confidence to work safely on SSH.


## Week 3: Processes, Jobs, and Background Tasks
**Main topics:**  
- Foreground vs. background jobs  
- Suspending and resuming tasks (`fg`, `bg`)  
- Process IDs and signals  
- Using `kill`

**Reflection:**  
I learned how to keep long tasks running while continuing other work.

## Week 4: Jekyll and GitHub Pages
**Main topics:**  
- Installing and using Jekyll  
- Building static websites with Markdown  
- Using Bundler and Ruby gems  
- Hosting pages with GitHub Pages

**Reflection:**  
This final week combined everything: version control, automation, and publishing. Learning how to build a website with Jekyll was a great experience.

## Overall Reflection
The CLI course showed how much power lies in mastering the terminal.  
Even simple tools like `ssh`, `grep`, and `make` become powerful when combined.  
I now feel more confident working in terminals.
