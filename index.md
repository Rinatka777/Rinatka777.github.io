## Introduction

Hi, I’m **Rinat Sharifullin**, and I study linguistics at the **University of Helsinki**. Before that I was an emergency room nurse for 6 years.  
I have always been passionate about **programming** and tech-stuff in general and even got a chance to work as a **software engineer** for 1.5 years. 
Now my focus switched towards **Natural Language Processing** and **Machine Translation** because next year I move forward to a master's degree in 
**Language technology**.
Outside of university, I am passionate about **Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu** and **programming** and in my free time I either train or code.
